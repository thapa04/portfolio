            <p> Me and my partner worked together to create a photos for our
            manipulation projct. We were assigned to a create changes to different
            images for a client. The client we chose was cause in Coding for Kids
            making a total of 5 images, we were able to successfully add captions
            a logo, a border and black shading. During our project, we came across
            many code errors when running. This project taught us to work through
            them and persevere. To create these images, we coded in the language
            python.

            <p> Me and two other group members
            worked together in my computer science class class to engineer an app. With the
            assistance of MIT inventor we
            created a photobooth app that is downloadable for android. Our app
            allowed the user take up to four
            images, color the images and share it on email. We made lots of
            modifications to the original adding
            different color options and customizations. As a group we faced many
            challenges. We encountered
            problems with the image facing the incorrect direction and resetting
            the canvas. However we collaborated
            well and were able to over come these challenges. We all had
            responsibilities on this project, mine was
            to work on the projects code and collaborate with one another on ideas
           for it. I took a lot away from
            working on this, It taught me how to overcome obstacles, stay
            persistent, and team management.</p>

         <p>Me and my team of 4
           worked to create a car powered only from hydrogen or solar cells.
           We applied our skills of simple machines, and energy to create an
           efficient car through vex parts as well as a vex motor. The 3 wheeled
            car car has a big to small gear ratio to maximize speed. The largest
            front wheel is spun though our gears and motor, dragging the back two wheels.
            For our car, we used only solar energy as we found hydrogen cells to add too much weight.
            Overall our speed was 4.35 seconds in one meter. While designing and testing our car,
             we encountered many challenges. One of them was finding away to manage our limited space
              that was given to us. We found it difficult to fit in two solar panels while making a
               longer and less wide car. Personally, on this project I had the role of designing the main base of the car and building the power sources.
              Overall, I have learned a lot from this
               project, most importantly, the process of trial and error and the
               perseverance involved when designing something.

      <p>Me and my group of developers worked on an interactive gameboard project, programmed on Greenfoot.
        Using our knowledge from Runestone Javascript, we successfully programmed a game that consist of 40 tiles, two dice and 10 questions.
        When the user rolls the two dice and lands on a question tile, a popup presents a multiple choice question based on Runestone Units 10-12. The objective of the game is to try and reach the end in as few turns as possible One of the biggest challenges we had was creating a movement algorithm that would automatically turn the player, we figured it out by storing the previous direction and checking it with the possible future directions
Another challenge we had dealt with was removing the popup screen after the question was answered, initially we had the code to “listen” for object interactions outside of the act method
