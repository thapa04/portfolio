            <p> Me and two other group members, Anirudh and Brian 
            worked together in Mr.Browns CSP class to engineer an app. With the
            assistance of MIT inventor we
            created a photobooth app that is downloadable for android. Our app 
            allowed the user take up to four
            images, color the images and share it on email. We made lots of
            modifications to the original adding
            different color options and customizations. As a group we faced many 
            challenges. We encountered
            problems with the image facing the incorrect direction and resetting
            the canvas. However we collaborated 
            well and were able to over come these challenges. We all had 
            responsibilities on this project, mine was
            to work on the projects code and collaborate with Anirudh on ideas 
           for it. I took a lot away from
            working on this, It taught me how to overcome obstacles, stay
            persistent, and team management.</p>

         <p>Me and my partner Advaith worked together in
         Mr Browns CSP class to program a platforming game 
         using scratch. Our app uses a ghost sprite that
         floats around levels.The player must avoid the lava and hit the yellow beam.
            Unfortunately  we did not have time to perfect it as much as we wanted to and we found
         the jump mechanics to be a bit buggy. We intended it to be a multiplayer game
         but never got to that stage in the game. My role was programming the scratch and creating the levels.
         I helped a little with writing as well. Doing this
         taught me a lot about the fundamentals of coding 
         and what is required in them. I also learned how to stay patient when coding
         During this project me and my partner had to collaborate a lot to reach our goals we set.</p>
