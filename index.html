           <p>My name is Shashank Thapa, and my goal is to become a software engineer.  I would like to work at a company like Workday helping design software products. I am currently a 10th grader at Dublin High School, now taking Principles of Engineering and have taken Computer Science Principles. I also do hackathons to sharpen my coding skills. In order to achieve my goal of becoming a software engineer,
              I will continue to excel at these things, as well as take Computer science applications and higher math courses.
              I also plan on attending UC colleges and majoring in software engineering, in order to continue pursuing my goal.
</p>
    <p>I have wanted to be a software engineer, since I was 12 years old. When I was younger, my dad would always tell me about his work experience as a software engineer. He would explain to me how he constantly learning new information and trying out new forms of languages, testing new things etc. My dad also told me about how he would go to different places to work and would have a flexible working schedule. On top of this I would always be fascinated with how computers and screens would work and be able to run programs at a high rate. This was what ignited my passion, I felt that working and interacting with a team to develop or test projects would be the dream for me.

</p>

<p>Some of my personal strengths I have are that I work well with others. I feel like I am cooperative and communicate well in teams. I can compromise well and not let personal ego get in the way of a project, I have had experience taking two engineering classes and doing a lot of projects with groups. Another personal strength I have is perseverance, especially in coding. In my computer science projects I would encounter many issues but kept working at them for hours. I feel like my ability to never give up is extremely important.
</p>Some important achievements of mine are coding my own website. I have designed my own website using Css and HTML. I have a good knowledge in these languages . I also have a bit of an understanding in Python and image manipulation. I know the variables roles for these languages. Another achievement I have is successfully designing a most cost effective raspberry pi security camera that takes pictures of faces. I am also fluent in english, skilled in Spanish and have a basic understanding of hindi.


While I am only a 10 grader, I have learned a few things about myself. This includes how I have grown as a programmer and engineer, how I can think for myself and outside the box. Finally the most important thing I learned is how to overcome difficult obstacles and go around them.
