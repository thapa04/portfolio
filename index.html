        <div class="col-md-8">

           <p>My name is Shashank Thapa, and my goal is to become a software engineer.
              I would like to work at a prestigious software company such as Workday,
               helping design, test and develop
              software products. I am currently a 10th grader at Dublin High
              School, now taking Principles of Engineering and have taken
               Computer Science Principles in my freshmen year. On occasion, I participate and host
                hackathons to sharpen
                my coding skills. In order to achieve my goal of becoming a
                software engineer,
               I will continue to excel at these computer science oriented skills, as well as take
              Computer science applications and higher math courses to improve logistical thinking.
              I plan on attending college, preferablly inside California that are well known for Computer Science.
               My major of choice will also be Computer Science, so I can pursue my goal

</p>
    <p>I have wanted to be a Software engineer since I was 12 years old.
      When I was younger, my dad would always tell me
      about his work experiences as a software engineer.
       He would explain to me how he constantly is learning new
       information, trying out new forms of languages, testing, developing and much more.
        My dad also mentioned to me about the variety of people he would see and the places he would visit while working.
        On top of this I would always be fascinated with how computers a
         would function and be able to run programs at a high rate.
        This was what ignited my passion at such a young age, I feel that working and interacting
        with a team to develop, test, and design projects would be an ideal position of employment for me.
        My dream is to work as a Software engineer, with likeminded people working towards the same goal.

<p>One of my personal strengths I posess is being able to
   work well with others. I am cooperative and communicate well
  in teams. I take pride in my communication skills and not letting my personal ego
   get in the way of a
   project. I have had experience working with a variety of people from
    taking two engineering classes and doing a lot of projects with groups. On top of that, my entire life,
     I have played team sports. For example, currently I play Volleyball, a sport requiring communication non stop and teammwork.
     Another personal strength I have is perseverance, especially in coding.
     In my Computer Science projects, there was an instance where my code had broken for a Python project.
     When I encountered this issue, I stayed up through the night troubleshooting and working
      until I found a result I was happy with. I believe my ability to never give up is extremely valuable to anyone.
</p>Some important achievements of mine are coding my own website.
I have designed my own website using Css, HTML and Javascript.
I have a good knowledge in these languages as well as a bit of an understanding in Python.
Another achievement I have is successfully designing a cost effective raspberry pi security camera that takes pictures.
I am fluent in English, skilled in Spanish and have a basic understanding of Hindi.


While I am only a 10th grader,
I have learned a few things about myself. This includes how I have grown as a
programmer and engineer. I have developed the ability to think for myself and
outside the box. Finally, the most important thing I learned is how to overcome
difficult obstacles and work at them.
