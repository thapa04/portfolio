           <p>My name is Shashank Thapa, and my goal is to
             become a software engineer. In my Computer Science and Engineering classes, I explored the world of programming, familiarizing myself with Python and Javascript.
               By learning the complexities and elegance of computer languages, I recognized the
                value of mastering mathematical theorems and algorithms.
               Programming provided me with knowledge of how machines behave, communicate with one another,
               and eventually create products, goods, and services that better serve humanity. I would like to work in a vibrant
              and passionate company where I can help test and design software
               products.
</p>
    <p>
      I am a 12th grader at Dublin High School.
    Currently taking the course AP Computer Science Applications.
      I have also previously taken other Stem related classes such as
      Computer Science Principles and Principles of Engineering. In order to achieve
      my goal of becoming a software engineer,
       I will continue to excel at these things,
      by enrolling in, higher math
      courses in college. I plan on majoring in Engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in the fall to continue my interest in the field.
<div>
<p>Some personal strengths I possess is my ability to work well with others.
   I am cooperative and communicate well in teams. I can compromise well and not
    let my personal ego get in the way of a project. I have experience taking two
    engineering classes and doing a lot of projects with groups. Another
    personal strength I retain is perseverance, especially in coding. In my
    Computer Science projects I would encounter many issues but kept working at
     them for hours. My ability
     to never give up is an extremely important quality, especially in the engineering world.

</p>Some important achievements of mine are coding my own website.
 I have designed my own website using CSS, HTML and Javascript. Overall,
 I have a strong understanding of these languages. I have participated and hosted a
 number of hackathons with teams to design projects using these languages. In
 the past, I have successfully created a cost-effective raspberry pi security
 camera with facial recognition. I am a fluent speaker in English, skilled in
 Spanish and have a basic understanding of Hindi.
  I have been playing volleyball for 6 years and currently on the boys
  Dublin High Varsity team. Being a senior, I have learned a
   few things about myself. This includes how I have grown as a programmer
    and engineer, how I can think for myself and outside the box.


<p>
  <p>
 Being an athlete has taught me how to be a part of
 something bigger than myself. From playing a variety of team sports over the
  years I know how important it selflessness is and leadership. These principals
   will go a long way for me in the future. As a student, I have learned a lot
    concerning what it takes to be a good engineer.
