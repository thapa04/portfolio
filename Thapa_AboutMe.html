        <div class="col-md-8">

           <p>         My name is Shashank Thapa and I am a student from Dublin High . I hope to go into the field of software
            and computers. Computers and software have always been a part of who I am and interest me greatly. 
            One of my interests is gaming and it has always fascinated me how they are made. With this I plan to pursue this interest
            by taking Computer science principles as my elective. I hope to further expand my understanding in this field and take this 
            in college.</p>
    <p>I believe I have lots of good qualities and experiences that will help me in this field. One quality that is required as a 
    software engineer is persistence and self motivation . I have dealt with multiple examples of persistance, many of the sports teams
    I have played on required lots of discipline and motivation. Karate in particular has taught me a lot and has shaped my character.I 
    think this would translate to a software job as I can confidently be able to work through any troubles I deal with.
    Playing Basketball, volleyball and soccer are all team sports I took part in as well. I aquired a sense of being a team player 
    and working with all types of people in many situations. In the real world of a job this is extremely beneficial. Little to no jobs in
    an software field are done alone, they are done in teams and it is good to know how to work in your team and face adversary.

<p>Experiences in my middle school and high school life have taught me a lot. I like to volunteer for the Dublin Key Club. Recently
I have gone on many trips, one involving the pediatric trauma program. I have also helped out at the Dublin library. Volunteering has gave me a
sense of responsibility, organization and time management I will need in life. During middle school I was part of the band all 
three years. This has helped my artistic and creative side development. This is just a short summary of me and I hope you will explore the 
rest of my website. Thank you for your time.
